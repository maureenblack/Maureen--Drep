    "comment": "First of all, this represents our first-ever community treasury budget and demands a cautious approach. The proposed 200M limit allows us to fund critical development while ensuring we maintain treasury growth. According to community models, approximately 350M ADA flows into the treasury annually, meaning this limit still allows for continued growth while we refine our governance processes.\n\nSecond, a lower NCL creates essential constraints that force us to prioritize the most impactful proposals rather than approving everything that sounds interesting. Without these constraints, we risk depleting the treasury faster than intended, potentially endangering long-term ecosystem sustainability.\nThird, the community currently has limited experience managing treasury withdrawals and evaluating their market impact. We need to observe how selling 200M ADA affects both the ecosystem and token value before considering higher limits. This gives us valuable data for future NCL decisions.\n\nFinally, this NCL covers just eight months remaining in 2025, making it a perfect trial period for our governance systems. After gaining practical experience with budget administration, auditing, and impact assessment, we can establish a more informed NCL for 2026 based on real-world results rather than theoretical projections.\nThis will be a great step at establishing responsible treasury management from the very beginning of Cardano's decentralized governance era."
