    "comment": "I'm voting no not because I'm against domains conceptually, but because this feels like a resource allocation that doesn't match ecosystem pain points.  The info action contains no CIP, no technical architecture, no smart contract specifications. I was told tokenization and Web3 integration are \"ambitions\" that will be figured out after ICANN delegation, but i don't see the specifics. All that aside, the SEO disadvantage of new gTLDs is well-documented and wasn't adequately addressed. Most projects will keep their .com/.io domains for discoverability and use .ada as vanity redirects at best. The visibility and legitimacy benefits are theoretical. The defensive registration argument against scams doesn't hold up - scammers will continue using hundreds of other TLDs regardless of who owns .ada. Furthermore, the Community Advisory Group is informal and not yet formalized. We don't know its structure, its powers, or its accountability mechanisms. Advisory means CF retains final decision-making authority. I don't really really like that. For infrastructure that affects the entire ecosystem's namespace, we need binding governance before endorsement, not promises to figure it out later. Also, the economics of this investment are quite questionable. At $25 per domain with $350k annual operating costs, this requires 14,000 registrations yearly to break even. CF's own domain experts estimate anywhere from 3,000 to 30,000 annual registrations... wildly uncertain. If volume falls short, either CF subsidizes losses indefinitely from their substantial treasury, or the project fails after burning the initial investment. There's no clear sustainability plan.  Our ecosystem faces real infrastructure gaps. DeFi needs liquidity depth, developers need better tooling, projects need security audits and ecosystem coordination. $4.2M over 10 years could address those concrete needs instead of buying namespace from ICANN. We're spending millions to subordinate our namespace to Web2 gatekeepers rather than investing in truly decentralized alternatives. I want to be proven wrong. I want this to be brilliant strategy I'm too shortsighted to see. But based on the information provided, Icannot in good conscience endorse spending on ICANN namespace with vague governance and uncertain utility when that capital could address concrete problems facing Cardano builders today."
